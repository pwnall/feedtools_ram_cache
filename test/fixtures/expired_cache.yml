        <title>David Van Tieghem, Kit Fitzgerald and John Sanborn&#39;s Ear to the Ground (1982).</title>
        <link>http://events.mit.edu/event.html?id=11280023&amp;rss</link>
        <description>Working as a collaborative team from 1976 until 1982, Kit Fitzgerald and John Sanborn created dynamic fusions of video art and television tactics. Their kinetic use of editing and post-production effects defined their energetic juxtapositions of visual, musical and conceptual themes. In &lt;I&gt;Ear to the Ground,&lt;/I&gt; Fitzgerald and Sanborn collaborated with acclaimed New York musician David Van Tieghem.  This 1982 video depicts Tieghem as he uses the city of Manhattan as his musical instrument, playing the surfaces of the sidewalks, buildings and phone booths with his drumsticks to elicit an ingenious range of percussive sounds.

        <title>OFF-CAMPUS:  Neri Oxman: At the Frontier of Ecological Design</title>
        <link>http://events.mit.edu/event.html?id=11286425&amp;rss</link>
        <description>Biology inspires Architecture graduate student Neri Oxman. Working at the interface of environmental design, science, and art, Oxman is inventing the future of energy-efficient building materials. A Presidential Fellow at MIT&#39;s Department of Architecture, Oxman is inventing novel ways to design, fabricate, assemble, and maintain building &quot;skins&quot; so they can respond to load, light, and heat simultaneously. Think buildings that breathe, sweat, and grow. &quot;I believe that, within two decades, buildings will be designed and constructed as biological tissues,&quot; says Oxman.

        <description>The exhibition takes as its departure the sketch, process, and change. Philbrick was invited by the Skissernas Museum to develop new work. This gave her the opportunity to work within the context of a place that values the &quot;in-process&quot; and the &quot;unfinished.&quot; The Skissernas Museum is literally a museum of sketches, housing an extensive collection of early drafts that reveal the beginnings of significant public artworks. Working between the Skissernas and MIT, Philbrick produced a &quot;Rammed Earth Sculpture Garden,&quot; now installed on the museum grounds; a fluorescent installation; a group of electronic drawings; and a handmade &quot;Exhibition Manual&quot; exhibition catalogue composed of texts contributed by MIT affiliates, soon to be available as a download from the websites of both the Skissernas and CAVS.

        <description>COSTS AND BENEFITS OF DOUBLE SKIN FACADES
    A case study of the design and construction process for an externally ventilated double skin facade for the University of Michigan Biomedical Science Research Bldg. The design process included extensive energy modeling, CFD analysis, value engineering, detailing design and control specifications. He will present a more general research project comparing the payback issues of double skin facades. The research included the wide variety capital costs as well as the variety of operational and maintenance costs and savings for 4 types of double skin facades in 5 climate types.

        <description>Double-dimer pairings and skew Young diagrams &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; We study the number of tilings of skew Young diagrams by ribbon tiles shaped like Dyck paths, in which the tiles are ``vertically decreasing&#39;&#39;. We use these quantities to compute pairing probabilities in the double-dimer model.  Given a planar bipartite graph G with special vertices, called nodes, on the outer face, the double-dimer model is formed by the superposition of a uniformly random dimer configuration (perfect matching) of G together with a random dimer configuration of the graph formed from G by deleting the nodes. The double-dimer configuration consists of loops, doubled edges, and chains that start and end at the boundary nodes.  We are interested in how the chains connect the nodes.  An interesting special case is when the graph is epsilon (Z x N) and the nodes are at evenly spaced locations on R as the grid spacing epsilon goes to 0. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Joint work with Rick Kenyon.</description>

    Let M be a compact symplectic manifold endowed with a Hamiltonian torus action. I will discuss how to extend the well-known result that components of a moment map for the action are Morse-Bott functions on M to make arguments about the topology of a partial level set. This may be used to make conclusions about orbifold invariants of symplectic quotients. The talk will include many examples, including toric orbifolds and quotients of coadjoint orbits by subtori of the maximal torus.</description>

        <description>How to form biofilm streamers in a microfluidic channel
    
    Bacterial biofilms are commonly identified as microbial communities attached to a surface and encased in a self-secreted extracellular matrix. Due to their increased resistance to antimicrobial agents, biofilms have an enormous impact on health and medicine (e.g., wound healing, implant-associated infections, disease transmission). On the other hand, they constitute a major component of the stream ecosystem by increasing transient storage and retention of suspended particles. In this talk, we present an experimental study of bacterial biofilm development in a microfluidic device. In particular, we show the formation of filamentous structures, or streamers, in curved channels and how these suspended biofilms are linked to the underlying hydrodynamics.</description>

        <description>The transformative discoveries required to solve urgent global problems, such as finding new drugs or environmentally-friendly energy sources, are ultimately limited by our ability to sift through vast numbers of samples. We introduce an ultra-high-throughput microfluidic screening platform using picoliter-volume emulsion drops as reaction vessels. We apply the system to the directed evolution of the enzyme horseradish  peroxidase and improve the catalytic rate by &amp;gt;10-fold. This unprecedented improvement in the activity of this enzyme was achieved with a one-thousand-fold reduction in time and a greater than one-million-fold reduction in cost compared to the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

        <title>Change Ringing Practice (Hand Bells)</title>
        <link>http://events.mit.edu/event.html?id=11288949&amp;rss</link>
        <description>Change ringing is a style of bell ringing developed for large church bells in Britain several hundred years ago. It does not involve ringing a melody on the bells, but rather permuting the order of sounding the bells according to formal rules called methods. You don&#39;t need any musical skill or experience to learn change ringing. If you enjoy working with numerical patterns, chances are this will be an enjoyable activity for you! We are always looking for new ringers and would be glad to teach you to ring.</description>
